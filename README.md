# Terminal-Tetris

</p>For the summer after my freshman spring semester, I decided on coding a game for practice, instead of sitting idly and doing nothing. I settled on the idea of recreating Tetris when I was watching CodeBullet's videos, "I Created An A.I. to DESTROY Tetris" and "Using A.I. to DOMINATE Nerds in TETRIS".<br> Since I didn't know how to use any game engines, I decided to make it in the WSL Ubuntu terminal.</p>

##### DISCLAIMER
</p>This is not to infringe on the game TETRIS in any way shape or form.<br>I do NOT own any rights to the game.<br>This is just for practice and there will be no monetization of any kind.</p>
